### What's interesting?
I find the development of CLARI, the Compliant Legged Articulated Robotic Insect, to be intriguing due to its ingenious blend of nature-inspired design and cutting-edge technology. It draws inspiration from the flexibility and shape of insects, as well as their modular design which allows for eazy customizations. Furthermore, CLARI's ability to passively change its shape allows it to navigate confined spaces with ease, which opens doors to many practical applications, from search and rescue missions in disaster-stricken areas to exploration of environments previously inaccessible to traditional robots. 


### Comment

Megan Chen: I think this is an interesting project and it would potentially have a lot of cool uses at the intersection of design and technology. A lot of the stuff we learn in school is mainly software, so it's cool to see how tech like this is integrated into the physical world.
